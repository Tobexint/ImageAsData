# Summary
 In this lesson, we'll learn how to work with tensors in PyTorch. We'll also explore the dataset for this project, focusing on how images are represented in tensors.

## Objectives
- Check important attributes of tensors, such as size, data type, and device.
- Manipulate tensors through slicing.
- Perform mathematical operations with tensors, including matrix multiplication and aggregation calculations.
- Download and decompress the dataset for this project.
- Load and explore images using PIL.
- Demonstrate how visual information is stored in tensors, focusing on color channels.
